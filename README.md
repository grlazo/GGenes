# GGenes
GGenes: Report generating cgi-bin scripts for the GrainGenes MySQL database for small grains.

Presented are cgi-bin executables for the GrainGenes database run under two environments: 
1) GG2: a standard cgi-bin set reading from a MySQL database and generating reports under 
a standard web interface, and 2) GG3: the same set of cgi-bin executables serving from a 
MySQL database to a Drupal CMS instance of the website with the database contained within 
a frame document for the database.
